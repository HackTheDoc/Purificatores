# Purificatores

Welcome to this first trial in artificial life !

I sware the gods, i am so excited by this !!!


## Current State of the project
Actually, it is going pretty well.
I have a nice reproduction system so my little babies die or born as wanted.
There is no more spontaneous birth.

But weirdly, if the starting population is to low, the simulation end up not working. This is pretty bizarre. I'll have to find out what's going one, but i am to exhausted to do it today.

See ya <3
